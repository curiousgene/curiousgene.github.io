My name is Gene. I've used the nickname/handle/whatever "curiousgene" since DefCon 7, which is more years ago than I care to count.
I'm a Systems Engineer in the Film and TV business. I play guitar in a band called [Paddy's Pig](https://www.paddyspig.com). I have 
a Master's degree in English from [Signum University](https://www.ignumuniversity.org). I'm married, I have two kids, and I live in
Los Angeles.
