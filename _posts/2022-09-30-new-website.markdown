I'm moving various things out of Google's services and into other places. For my long-neglected website, that means GitHub pages, and this here
new thing. 

I have been spurred into action in no small part by having had to confront my own mortality, courtesy of my cancer diagnosis. While
in treatment, I've been looking at the things around me, and seeing that there's a lot of clutter, both physical and metaphorical, that I can
get rid of. There's also neglected aspects of my life that I now feel very invested in exploring.

So, new page. Now that I'm done with my Master's degree, some of my academic work will end up here. I'm temporarily not playing show with 
[Paddy's Pig](https://www.paddyspig.com), (bars being a bad place for somebody with a compromised immune system), but I have other musical
avenues to explore. And so on.
