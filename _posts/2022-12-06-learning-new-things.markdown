"During cancer treatment" is probably not the best time to try learning new stuff. I've noticed that I'm not exactly operating
at peak efficiency. My brain is a bit foggy, especially in the days following an infusion. That said, I've got a lot of free
time, and since I finished my Master's degree, I've been turning my focus back to music. So I'm learning Max/MSP and Puredata.

<!–more–>

I've been unable to perform with Paddy's Pig since I started chemo, but still play my guitars, and I've been making notes of
melodies and chord progressions and lyrics for years. What I haven't done is finish any songs, or do much actual recording. I
have decided that, when this whole "cancer" thing is done with (and my plan is for it to be done with and then have another 30
or 40 years left), I'd like to start releasing music and performing. I've been listening to a lot of experimental, electronic,
and ambient music lately, and performing as a solo guitar player is certainly a possibility.

To that end, aside from practicing in a more focused fashion, I've started learning [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max)
and [Puredata](https://www.puredata.info). They're very similar environments, and I should probably just be focusing on one at a
time, but it's actually been helpful to take things I learned in one, and then try to figure out how to do the same thing in the
other. Repetition has been key to me actually retaining things. I've been working through [Electronic Music and Sound Design](https://www.contemponet.com/shop/electronic-music-and-sound-design-1-max-8/), and I've been having to read each section
at least twice before it sticks. Taking Max exercises and trying to duplicate them in Puredata makes me think about them in
different ways, and it's helping the material stick.

I'm also continually getting distracted by learning more about [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com), and looking at the manual
for my audio interface (an [iConnectivity](https://www.iconnectivity.com) iConnectAudio4+) because (for instance) the routing isn't
working like I expected, and having to take apart pedals to clean scratchy pots, and so on. It feels like I'm making progress,
though.
